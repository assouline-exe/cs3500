To run our program, first load the image. Input command 'load', a space, the file path of the image
you want to load, insert another space, and then input the name you want to load the image under.

Then input the type of transformation you want to apply on the image. Can be one of:
brighten, red-component, green-component, blue-component, value-component, intensity-component,
luma-component, sharpen, sepia, blur, horizontal-flip, vertical-flip.
After specifying the type of transformation, input the name of the image you want to apply the
transformation to, insert a space, and then input the name that the new image should be called. An
example of how to format commands is shown below.

To save this new image created by the transformation, input command 'save', a space, the file path
of where you want the image to save, insert another space, and then input the name of the image
to save. You can also use save to convert from one image file format to another, as shown below.

Note: For only the brighten command, before specifying the name of the image you want to apply
the transformation to, you must input how much you want to brighten the image. This will be a
number. A positive number brightens an image and a negative number darkens an image.
