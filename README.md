# CS3500
Final project submissions for Northeastern's CS3500, Object-Oriented Design.

Over the course, we worked on two primary projects- one to create a Marble Solitaire game and one to create an image processor. 
Each assignment required extending additional functionality to the program, and thus implementing good design principles was 
crucial. 

You can read more about my experience in the course and what I learned on my site.
